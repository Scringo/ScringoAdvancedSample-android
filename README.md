ScringoAdvancedSample-android
=============================

This sample contains all the libraries it requires, including __Scringo__  

To make it work you need to:  
1. Download the sample.  
2. Open with Eclipse.  
3. Replace YOUR_SCRINGO_APP_ID in __ScringoSample/assets/scringo.properties__ with your Scringo App Id (See below how to obtain it if you don't have one already).  
4. Run.  

To obtain a __Scringo__ App Id you need to sign up with __Scringo__ and create your first App. Follow the instructions in http://docs.scringo.com/android-guides/quickstart/ to achieve that.

Good Luck
